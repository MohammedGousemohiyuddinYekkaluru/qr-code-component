## 💻 My Process

### Built With
- Semantic **HTML5**
- **CSS3** (Flexbox, responsive units)
- Google Fonts (**Outfit**)
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned
While working on this challenge, I practiced:
- Centering elements using **flexbox**
- Using `max-width` and `rem/%` for responsiveness
- Styling images with `border-radius`
- Structuring a simple card component

```css
.container {
   display: flex;
   justify-content: center;
   align-items: center;
   height: 100vh;
}

## 📈 Continued Development

### I want to improve further by:

- Practicing more Frontend Mentor challenges

- Refining my responsive design skills

- Getting more comfortable with CSS variables and utility classes.
